To control the availability of sync, use the 'SyncDisabled' (Disable synchronization of data using Microsoft sync services) policy instead. If you set this policy to 'Disable browser sign-in', make sure that you also set the 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' (Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account) policy to disabled because 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' disables the creation of an automatically signed in browser profile. If both policies are set, Microsoft Edge will use the 'Disable browser sign-in' policy and behave as if 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' is set to disabled. If you set this policy to 'Enable browser sign-in' (1), users can sign into the browser. Signing into the browser doesn't mean that sync is turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. If you set this policy to 'Force browser sign-in' (2) users must sign into a profile to use the browser. By default, this will allow the user to choose whether they want to sync to their account, unless sync is disabled by the domain admin or with the 'SyncDisabled' policy. The default value of 'BrowserGuestModeEnabled' (Enable guest mode) policy is set to false. If you don't configure this policy users can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit. * 0 = Disable browser sign-in * 1 = Enable browser sign-in * 2 = Force users to sign-in to use the browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Enabled > Browser sign-in settings (Device): Force users to sign-in to use the browser |

By default, Microsoft Edge doesn't send Do Not Track requests, but users can turn on this feature to send them. If you enable this policy, Do Not Track requests are always sent to websites asking for tracking info. If you disable this policy, requests are never sent. If you don't configure this policy, users can choose whether to send these requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Enabled                                                                                |
| Microsoft Edge\Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account | This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account. If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user. If you want to configure browser sign in, use the 'BrowserSignin' (Browser sign-in settings) policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Enabled                                                                                |

| Microsoft Edge\SmartScreen settings\Configure Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block potentially unwanted apps                | This policy setting lets you configure whether to turn on blocking for potentially unwanted apps with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Potentially unwanted app blocking with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen provides warning messages to help protect users from adware, coin miners, bundleware, and other low-reputation apps that are hosted by websites. Potentially unwanted app blocking with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is turned off by default. If you enable this setting, potentially unwanted app blocking with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is turned on.

### Microsoft Edge Password Manager

**NOTE** the following password manager and protection settings are counter to securty best practices. The reason these are recommended has to do with students who may have issues with long/complex passwords. If this is the case for your students, set the below settings. If you disable Enable saving passwords to the password manager, the other three settings aren't needed. However if you want to allow Edge to save passwords, then the other three options might be useful if your students have issues with complex passwords.

Password protection alerts users when they reuse their protected password on potentially suspicious sites. You can use the 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' (Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service should capture fingerprint of password) and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL' (Configure the change password URL) policies to configure which passwords to protect. Exemptions: Passwords for the sites listed in 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL', as well as for the sites listed in 'SmartScreenAllowListDomains' (Configure the list of domains for which Microsoft Defender SmartScreen won't trigger warnings), will not trigger a password-protection warning. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOff' (0) to not show password protection warningss. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse' (1) to show password protection warnings when the user reuses their protected password on a non-allowlisted site. If you disable or don't configure this policy, then the warning trigger is not shown. * 0 = Password protection warning is off. * 1 = Password protection warning is triggered by password reuse. | Enabled (Password protection warning is off) |
