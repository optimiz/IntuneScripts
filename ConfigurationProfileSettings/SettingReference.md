Some parts of sites might not work) If you disable this policy or don't configure it, users can set their own level of tracking prevention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Enabled (Strict)                                                                       |

To control the availability of sync, use the 'SyncDisabled' (Disable synchronization of data using Microsoft sync services) policy instead. If you set this policy to 'Disable browser sign-in', make sure that you also set the 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' (Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account) policy to disabled because 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' disables the creation of an automatically signed in browser profile. If both policies are set, Microsoft Edge will use the 'Disable browser sign-in' policy and behave as if 'NonRemovableProfileEnabled' is set to disabled. If you set this policy to 'Enable browser sign-in' (1), users can sign into the browser. Signing into the browser doesn't mean that sync is turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. If you set this policy to 'Force browser sign-in' (2) users must sign into a profile to use the browser. By default, this will allow the user to choose whether they want to sync to their account, unless sync is disabled by the domain admin or with the 'SyncDisabled' policy. The default value of 'BrowserGuestModeEnabled' (Enable guest mode) policy is set to false. If you don't configure this policy users can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit. * 0 = Disable browser sign-in * 1 = Enable browser sign-in * 2 = Force users to sign-in to use the browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Enabled > Browser sign-in settings (Device): Force users to sign-in to use the browser |

Do Not Track requests let the websites you visit know that you don't want your browsing activity to be tracked. By default, Microsoft Edge doesn't send Do Not Track requests, but users can turn on this feature to send them. If you enable this policy, Do Not Track requests are always sent to websites asking for tracking info. If you disable this policy, requests are never sent.

| Microsoft Edge\Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account | This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account. If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user.

### Microsoft Edge Password Manager

**NOTE** the following password manager and protection settings are counter to securty best practices. The reason these are recommended has to do with students who may have issues with long/complex passwords. If this is the case for your students, set the below settings. If you disable Enable saving passwords to the password manager, the other three settings aren't needed. However if you want to allow Edge to save passwords, then the other three options might be useful if your students have issues with complex passwords.

Password protection alerts users when they reuse their protected password on potentially suspicious sites. You can use the 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' (Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service should capture fingerprint of password) and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL' (Configure the change password URL) policies to configure which passwords to protect. Exemptions: Passwords for the sites listed in 'PasswordProtectionLoginURLs' and 'PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL', as well as for the sites listed in 'SmartScreenAllowListDomains' (Configure the list of domains for which Microsoft Defender SmartScreen won't trigger warnings), will not trigger a password-protection warning. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOff' (0) to not show password protection warningss. Set to 'PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse' (1) to show password protection warnings when the user reuses their protected password on a non-allowlisted site. If you disable or don't configure this policy, then the warning trigger is not shown. * 0 = Password protection warning is off. * 1 = Password protection warning is triggered by password reuse. | Enabled (Password protection warning is off) |

| OneDrive\Prevent users from syncing personal OneDrive accounts (User)                                                            | **Note** Even though this is flagged as a (User) policy, it will still apply when targeting to a group of devices. This setting lets you block users from signing in with a Microsoft account to sync their personal OneDrive files. If you enable this setting, users will be prevented from setting up a sync relationship for their personal OneDrive account. Users who are already syncing their personal OneDrive when you enable this setting won't be able to continue syncing (and will be shown a message that syncing has stopped), but any files synced to the computer will remain on the computer. If you disable or do not configure this setting, users can sync their personal OneDrive accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Enabled                                                                                                                      |
| OneDrive\Silently move Windows known folders to OneDrive                                                                         | This setting lets you redirect known folders to OneDrive without any user interaction. In sync app builds below 18.171.0823.0001, this setting only redirects empty known folders to OneDrive (or known folders already redirected to a different OneDrive account). In later builds, it redirects known folders that contain content and moves the content to OneDrive. We recommend using this setting together with "Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive." If moving the known folders silently does not succeed, users will be prompted to correct the error and continue. If you enable this setting and provide your tenant ID, you can choose whether to display a notification to users after their folders have been redirected. You can move all folders at once or select the folders you want to move. After a folder is moved, this policy will not affect that folder again, even if you clear the check box for the folder. If you disable or do not configure this setting, your users' known folders will not be silently redirected and/or moved to OneDrive. | Enabled                                                                                                                      |

| OneDrive\Silently sign in users to the OneDrive sync app with their Windows credentials                                          | This setting lets you silently sign in users to the OneDrive sync app (OneDrive.exe) with their Windows credentials. If you enable this setting, users who are signed in on the PC with the primary Windows account (the account used to join the PC to the domain) can set up the sync app without entering the credentials for the account. Users will still be shown OneDrive Setup so they can select folders to sync and change the location of their OneDrive folder. If a user is using the previous OneDrive for Business sync app (Groove.exe), the new sync app will attempt to take over syncing the user's OneDrive from the previous app and preserve the user's sync settings. This setting is frequently used together with "Set the maximum size of a user's OneDrive that can download automatically" on PCs that don't have Files On-Demand, and "Set the default location for the OneDrive folder." If you disable or do not configure this setting, users will need to sign in with their work or school account to set up sync.                                               | Enabled                                                                                                                      |

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Security Configuration (HVCI) (Optional)

Configures Memory Integrity also known as Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI). This is enabled by default on new installs of Windows 11 22H2+ on Intel 8th gen and AMD Zen 2 or later processors. Deploying this will configure it for machines that were not newly installed with Windows 11 22H2+. This will fix the warning about Memory Integrity not being configured in Windows Security center.

Memory integrity works better with Intel Kabylake and higher processors with *Mode-Based Execution Control*, and AMD Zen 2 and higher processors with *Guest Mode Execute Trap* capabilities. Older processors rely on an emulation of these features, called *Restricted User Mode*, and will have a bigger impact on performance.

Some applications and hardware device drivers may be incompatible with memory integrity. This incompatibility can cause devices or software to malfunction and in rare cases may result in a boot failure (blue screen). Such issues may occur after memory integrity has been turned on or during the enablement process itself. If compatibility issues occur, see [Troubleshooting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity#troubleshooting) for remediation steps.

This configuration profile also configures System Guard Secure Launch which defends against firmware attacks. More info about System Guard Secure Launch can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows).

Configuring both of these settings plus Bitlocker allows for the device to be configured as a [Secured-Core PC.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure-11)

We mark this configuration profile as optional due to the hardware requirements for memory integrity. Please test this configuration on a group of devices before deploying to production. While this allows for an increased security state of the device, potential performance and driver/application compatibility issues could arise.

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab (SharedPC)

For shared device scenarios (Carts and Labs) we recommend using SharedPC. SharedPC will provide the optimal settings for an EDU shared configuration, allowing the device to clean up stale user profiles, configure power policy settings to allow the device to wake up and allow Windows Update to install updates outside of class time, and improved performance and enhanced privacy for users.

For more information, check out the [Shared PC technical reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/shared-pc-technical) for a list of the local policies Shared PC configures.

Note that if you want to use OneDrive for Business, a custom policy needs to be configured outside of the Settings catalog. The current SharedPC configuration in the Intune UI doesn't have the OneDrive for Business sync policy available yet.

### _MSFT - EDU - Student - General Restrictions

**Student User Settings**

These settings are primarily targeted to student users to prevent them from being able to install applications via the internet, USB drive, etc. When non-student users (teachers, IT Admins) sign on to student devices, these policies will not be applied (it may take a minute or so for the policy to sync down and remove the student restrictions after signing in).

**Note: Preventing Students from installing apps**

This process leverages Smart Screen and the Windows Store app to funnel application installs to the Store, however the Store will be blocked, preventing the user from being able to install apps. All self-service application installs should go through the Company Portal. Students will be able to use the Company Portal app to install applications you've made available to them via Intune (assuming you don't have any [primary user issues](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/tree/main/ChangeIntunePrimaryUser)).

Using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or Applocker both have their challenges. We've found using Smart Screen and blocking the store as an easy way to solve for this while preserving device usability and manageability.

| Scope                           | **Windows updates** this must be selected in order for Windows Update Reports in Intune to show any data. Do not confuse this with Windows Update for Business Reports (there are different settings to enable that data to be reported for clients).

| Scope                           | **Endpoint analytics** this allows for data to be collected for the Endpoint Analytics service to collect things like boot data and other telemetry to report on the health and performance of your devices. If you enabled Endpoint analytics already, this policy may already be configured. Check to see if you have any Windows Health Monitoring profile templates already configured in your tenant (could be under the name Intune data collection policy) | Check the box |

### Custom

The following custom policies are imported

- [_MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab Enable OneDrive for Business](https://github.com/rbalsleyMSFT/IntuneScripts/blob/main/ConfigurationProfileSettings/SettingReference.md#_msft---edu---device---shared-cartlab-enable-onedrive-for-business)
- _MSFT - EDU - Device - Skip ESP User Status Page
- _MSFT - EDU - Student - Deny Admin Apps

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Shared Cart/Lab Enable OneDrive for Business

In Windows 11 22H2 SharedPC CSP was modified to allow for OneDrive for Business sync. Intune has yet to add this to the Shared PC settings, so for now this must be set via a custom OMA-URI setting. If you wish for your shared devices to have the ability to sync with OneDrive, you'll want to add this setting.

**Name:** Enable ODfB SharedPC
**OMA-URI:** ./Vendor/MSFT/SharedPC/EnableSharedPCModeWithOneDriveSync
**Data Type:** Boolean
**Value:** True

### _MSFT - EDU - Device - Skip ESP User Status Page

The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) has three phases

- Device preparation
- Device setup
- Account setup

The Device preparation phase enrolls the device in Intune and installs the Intune Management extension which is responsible for installing Win32 apps, remediations, device inventory, and much more.

The Device setup phase applies apps and polices that are targeted to the device.

The Account setup phase does the same as the device setup phase, but for the user.

The Account setup phase can take a very long time to process, increasing the amount of time it takes for a student or end-user to be able to use the device. For profiles that are targeted to users, they generally are applied right on sign in and with minimal delay that the Account setup phase is generally not needed.

**Name:** Skip ESP User Status Page
**OMA-URI:** ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/DMClient/Provider/MS DM Server/FirstSyncStatus/SkipUserStatusPage
**Data Type:** Boolean
**Value:** True

### _MSFT - EDU - Student - Deny Admin Apps

The following settings are primarily focused on student users to prevent them from being able to run administrative apps: cmd, powershell, reg, regedit, and terminal.

**Name:** Deny Admin apps EXE
**Description:** Block selected Administrative Apps: Cmd, PS, Regedit, or Registry Console Tool.
**OMA-URI:** ./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/ApplicationLaunchRestrictions/IntuneEdu/EXE/Policy
**Data Type:** String (XML File)
